# Website
This is the (soon to be) official website of the computer science guild, commit to make a difference! 

# Rules to participate
* All code shall have a description
* The commit messages needs to state what has been updated/added or deleted and why this is necessary
* Any backdoor implementation or other means to weaken the structural integrity of the website will result in a permanent ban.

# Good practice
* Keep the code clean and refactorize if needed.
* Use branches!
* Write great commit messages and pull requests.
This includes to use standard features like "closing #*".

## Branches
Currently we have one main branch and in a later stage we will have a production branch with the current state of the webpage. The production branch will be unreachable for everyone except the Admin team and they are responsible for merging major, stable changes to it.

Any questions, suggestions or complaints reach out to one of the admins.

The night is dark and full of terrors but the fire burns them all away.
