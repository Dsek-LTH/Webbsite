# Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dsek-LTH/Website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dsek-LTH/Website)

This is the (soon to be) official website of the computer science guild, commit to make a difference!

# Dependencies
This project intends to follow LTS (Long-term Support). At the time of writing the dependencies are:
- Node v6.11.0

# Rules to participate
* All code shall have a description
* The commit messages needs to state what has been updated/added or deleted and why this is necessary
* Any backdoor implementation or other means to weaken the structural integrity of the website will result in a permanent ban.

# Good practice
* Keep the code clean and refactorize if needed.
* Use branches!
* Write great commit messages and pull requests.
This includes to use standard features like "closing #*".

## Branches
Currently we have 2 main branches, master and dev. dev is the development branch, all pull requests shall be aimed at dev. 
master is our release branch and is unreachable to everyone except the Admin team. Here our current website with it's features will be and as soon as we've made major improvments on the dev branch we will merge them with master and change the hosted website to the code in master! 

Any questions, suggestions or complaints reach out to one of the admins.


The night is dark and full of terrors but the fire burns them all away.
