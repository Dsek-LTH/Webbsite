# Website
This is the (soon) official webbsite of the computer science guilds webbpage, commit to make a difference! 

# Rules to participate
* All code shall have a discription
* The commit message needs to state what has been updated/added or deleted and why this is nessicay
* Any backdoor implementation or other means to weaken the structural integrity of the website will result in a permanent ban.

# Good practice
* keep the code clean and refactorize if needed.
* Use branches!
* write great commit messages and pullrequests.
This includes to use standard features like "closing #*".

## Branches
Currently we have 2 main branches, master and dev. dev is the development branch, all pullrequests shall be aimed at dev. 
master is our release branch and is unreachable to everyone except the Admin team. Here our current webbsite with it's features will be and as soon as we've made major improvments on the dev branch we will merge them with master and change the hosted webbsite to the code in master! 

Any questions, suggestions or complaints reach out to one of the admins.


The night is dark and full of terrors but the fire burns them all away.
