# Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dsek-LTH/Website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dsek-LTH/Website)

This is the (soon to be) official website of the computer science guild, commit to make a difference!

# Dependencies
This project intends to follow LTS (Long-term Support). At the time of writing the dependencies are:
- Node v6.11.0

# Rules to participate
* All code shall have a description
* The commit messages needs to state what has been updated/added or deleted and why this is necessary
* Any backdoor implementation or other means to weaken the structural integrity of the website will result in a permanent ban.

# Good practice
* Keep the code clean and refactorize if needed.
* Use branches!
* Write great commit messages and pull requests.
This includes to use standard features like "closing #*".

# The next big step
If you are taking the next step towards writing code and wants to know how its done, read [Contributions](https://github.com/Dsek-LTH/Website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTIONS.md). If you can't find what you are looking for, contact either one of the Admins.
If you questions is of a bigger nature, such as collaboration with Dsek, our development team or questions regarding the project as whole, please contact [Mattemagikern](https://github.com/Mattemagikern) or [Axel Wihlborg](https://github.com/axelwihlborg).

## Branches
Currently we only have a master branch, and PRs are aimed towards the master branch.
Master is our release branch and is unreachable to everyone except the Admin team.


Feature branches may be used to implement new features, an example would be creating an "Admin Panel branch" when developing an Admin page.


Any questions, suggestions or complaints reach out to one of the admins.


The night is dark and full of terrors but the fire burns them all away.
